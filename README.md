### Personal Portfolio Website in React

This personal portfolio website is built using React, React-bootstrap for styling, and Animate.css for CSS animations.

#### Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   Clone the repository from GitHub to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/personal-portfolio.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
   Change your directory to the cloned project folder:

   ```bash
   cd personal-portfolio
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**
   Install the required dependencies using npm:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

#### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following commands:

- **npm start:**
  Runs the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser. The page will reload when you make changes, and any lint errors will be displayed in the console.

  ```bash
  npm start
  ```

- **npm test:**
  Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode. This is useful for testing your components during development.

  ```bash
  npm test
  ```

- **npm run build:**
  Builds the app for production to the build folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.

  ```bash
  npm run build
  ```

#### Deployment

Once you've completed development and are ready to deploy your website, follow these steps:

1. **Build the Production Version:**
   Run the following command to build the production version of your app:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Deploy to Hosting Provider:**
   Upload the contents of the `build` folder to your hosting provider. You can use services like Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages, or any other hosting provider of your choice.

3. **Verify Deployment:**
   Once your website is deployed, verify that it's working correctly by visiting the deployed URL.
